# SEO BLOG FullStack Project

- Hello , Everyone !
- I improved myself on frontend development, pepols things frontend developer makes web design or websites. I thought its not true Frontend developer does'nt have to need good vision... 
- If you want to be a good frontend developer you need to know backend and network...

- I started this project because of learning 'SEO' and backend with node.js (express).
- I have similarity with databaases but I cant say I know it right now. I want to say I'm ezpert about database systems when I fnished this project.

- I will share my experiences and many informations about this project here..

## Part 1 ( Initilasing the project.. )

- First thing first you need to create your project folders. 
- We will study like FullStack so we need to "Backend" and "Frontend" Folders.
- I started to create Server.js for node.js server. 
- For Saving our project on cloud I will use github. So need to say npm init -y in our backend folder. This will give us package.json file. "-y" is gives us the default package.json file. If you want to configure it you need to say just "npm init"
